Happy Valentine lovee<3

There's not much i can say in this digital letter rather than no more of a thank u for still accompanying me till rn.

Our journey together is a tapestry woven with shared moments, each one a precious thread in the fabric of our love story. You've become my home, the place where my heart feels safe, understood, and truly alive.

So here, in these few words, know that my love for you deepens with each passing day. You are the poetry my heart recites, the story my soul longs to tell. I cherish every chapter, eagerly anticipating the unwritten tales that lie ahead.

Always Yours, Arya.
